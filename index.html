    <h1>Benefits of Honey</h1>
    <div>
        <div>
            <h3>Rich in Antioxidants</h3>
            <p>Many of us enjoy honey and incorporate it into our daily diet, whether as a
                natural sugar substitute for our coffee or simply as a sweet treat. But
                specific honey varietals known as "active" honeys have also been utilised
                throughout history for their antibacterial and medicinal properties.
                Improves Cholesterol 
               </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Natural Cough Medicine</h3>
                <p> Honey is a time-honored remedy for a sore throat. According to one study
                    ,it can also relieve coughs more effectively than OTC medications that
                    contain dextromethorphan (DM). a cough suppressant. You can create
                    your own remedy at home by mixing up to 2 teaspoons of honey with
                    herbal tea or warm water and lemon. 
                   </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Lowers Blood Pressure</h3>
                <p> Blood pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease, and honey
                    may help lower it. This is because it contains antioxidant compounds that
                    have been linked to lower blood pressure. Studies in both rats and humans
                    have shown modest reductions in blood pressure from consuming honey. 
                   </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Improves Cholestoral</h3>
                <p>Studies have shown that consuming honey lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol
                    by 6-119% and lowers triglyceride levels by as much as 11%. Honey may
                    also increase HDL (good) cholesterol by about 39%. 
                   </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Improve Heart Health</h3>
                <p>It's high in antioxidants, such as phenolic acids and flavonoids, which may
                    support better health. Small studies in humans show honey's antioxidants
                    could help improve cholesterol levels, which could help decrease the risk
                    for heart disease, although larger long-term studies are needed to confirm
                    those findings.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Antibacterial properies</h3>
                <p>Honey contains hydrogen peroxide, which may account for some of its
                    antibacterial properties. It also has a high sugar content, which can help
                    stop the growth of certain bacteria. Additionally, honey has a low pH level.
                    This works to pull moisture away from bacteria, causing the bacteria to get
                    dehydrated and die off. </p>
